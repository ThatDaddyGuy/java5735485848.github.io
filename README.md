Beginners Portfolio of a Novice Coder
I made this porfolio to showcase the skills that I have learned from my courses at codecademy.com plus what I've learned from others and in my free time.
I first began to learn to code about two months ago when I learned HTML in order to "clear my mind" before bed because I was always up all night because I was always up all night because of PTSD. Eventually I just wanted to learn more. 
While this is just a work-in-progress from someone who is learning from Codecademy I am proud of the skills that I've learned and I hope that I'm able to take them out into the professional world. 
I've began to make this a workable website and I've had fun so far putting it together. Let me know what you think.
