        <p>
            Hello and welcome to my portfolio. I'm Johnny and I'm an aspiring coder that is beginning
            to learn to code and get into the coding industry. I first began learning to code HTML 
            as a way to calm my mind at night due to my PTSD from my poor life decisions. The result
            was that I signed up for a codecademy course and started my path torwards full stack
            engineer. I have made this portfolio as a way to showcase my skills and projects
            that I have worked on. I have made it a workable website to show my understanding of coding.
            I hope to grow it as time goes on and I learn more about coding and the industry.
